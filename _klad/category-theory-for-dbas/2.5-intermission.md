    Mathematicians have the unfortunate habit of keeping mathematics as something separate from the people who practise it. A particularly egregious example of this is Galois. His life tells a story about a time when students took up literal arms to fight for political change, when both the future of France and the foundations of modern mathematics were taking shape in Paris. To this date it's nigh impossible to open a modern mathematical textbook without at least encountering one of the names in this article.

Mathematicians have the unfortunate habit of keeping mathematics as something separate from the people who practise it. A particularly egregious example of this is Galois. His life tells a story about a time when students took up literal arms to fight for political change, when both the future of France and the foundations of modern mathematics were taking shape in Paris. To this date it's nigh impossible to open a modern mathematical textbook without at least encountering one of the names in this article.

Amongst mathematicians Galois is well known for laying the foundations for group theory, Galois theory (obviously) and using the two to show which polynomials can and cannot be solved and how[^solve], thereby solving a long list of old (literally ancient) mathematical problems. As will become clear he did not do so in vacuum, and he wasn't always the first. Yet even so Galois' theories were so complete and general that his work is often the standard theory and even now his theories show up in seemingly unrelated areas like clustering data.

This all started in 1828 when Galois applied to the École Polytechnique in Paris. He was rejected and entered the less prestigious École normale supérieure instead (which has since become one of the most renowned mathematical institutes). This initial rejection was likely due to Galois' inability to explain his ideas clearly enough, or perhaps in a way that only the brightest mathematical minds of the time could understand. This became a recurring pattern in the rest of his life.

A year later he did manage to get a paper published, but two papers on polynomial equations were rejected by none other than Cauchy[^cauchy]. Cauchy did however recognise the importance of these papers because he urged Galois to combine them and enter them in the competition for the Grand Prize in mathematics of the Academy of Sciences. Which Cauchy thought Galois would likely win.

Events took a turn for the worse when a political dispute with a priest drove Galois' father to commit suicide. A few days after that Galois attempted to the École Polytechnique again but didn't succeed this time around either. Accounts differ on the exact reason, but the most plausible explanation is that the examinator was completely baffled by an increasingly irate Galois who made logical leaps that the examinator had no hope of following. 

In late 1829 Galois completed his Baccalaureate at the École normale. A bit later he tried to enter the Grand Prize like Cauchy had suggested, by sending his paper to Fourier[^fourier] the secretary of the Academy of Science. Unfortunately Fourier died shortly after receiving Galois' submission, which has been lost. The competition was eventually won by Abel[^abel] (posthumously) and Jacobi[^jacobi]. During the following year Galois did publish three papers on Galois theory, finding the roots of polynomials, and number theory.

The year 1830 was a turbulent period in French politics. A brief and likely wrong recap is that after the people overthrew the monarchy they were then overthrown by Napoleon, then Louis XVIII, Napoleon (briefly), then Louis XVIII again followed by Charles X. This lasted until July 1830 when Charles X lost the election[^monarchy]. This then started off *another* French revolution (clearly the French were intent on trying anything at least twice). 

The reason I mention this is because Galois wasn't just a bystander to this all. Or well he was at first, but not willingly. The director of the École normale had locked him in, which lasted until Galois wrote a furious letter to the Gazette des Écoles, which caused him to be expelled. So Galois quit and joined the infamous Republican artillery unit of the National Guard, while still working on his mathematical theories.

This unit was later disbanded and several of its officers prosecuted for conspiring to overthrow the government. At the banquet celebrating their subsequent acquittal Galois was also present (as well as other illustrious people like Dumas[^dumas]) and was seen toasting to Louis Philippe (successor of Charles X) while holding a dagger above his cup. This was considered a threat to the new king and he was arrested the day after, but was eventually acquitted.

This didn't last however, as the following July the 14th Galois was arrested again, heavily armed, leading a protest. He continued the rest of his mathematical work from prison, where at one point his inmates goaded him to drink alcohol for the first time. While drunk he is said to have attempted suicide had his inmates not restrained him. After his release from prison months later Galois participated in a duel for reasons that remain unclear and lost his life at the age of 20. May 1832, a mere 3 years after first applying to the École Polytechnique. His funeral ended in riots.

Galois left his friend Auguste Chevalier a stack of 60 or so pages containing many important mathematical ideas with far reaching consequences[^liouville], and he left his brother Alfred the words "Ne pleure pas, Alfred! J'ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir à vingt ans!"[^translation]

--------------------------------------------------------------

[^solve]: Solving a polynomial here means writing an expression for its roots. Consider for example how all quadratic equations can be solved with the abc-formula. Similar formulae exist for cubic and quartic equations, but Galois showed such a formula cannot exist for higher order polynomials.

[^cauchy]: Famous for his work in analysis, limits, and giving his name to dozens of wikipedia pages.

[^fourier]: Yes that one.

[^abel]: Did a lot of things closely related to the things Galois was working on, in fact he was the first to show some polynomials couldn't be solved, which Galois later improved upon by showing exactly which polynomials couldn't be solved. He also independently described group theory, groups with operations that are symmetric (such as 'i.e. such that $x + y = y + x$' are called abelian). The Abel prize (mathematical answer to the Nobel prize) is also named after him. He died young in 1829 at 26 of tuberculosis.

[^jacobi]: Hard to summarize his contributions, his name shows up all over the place. Quite a lot of his work turned out to be incredibly useful in both classical and quantum mechanics, although quantum mechanics wouldn't exist until a century later.

[^monarchy]: The fact that a royal lost power because of an election in a constitutional monarchy should give a clear idea how complicated these times were politically.

[^dumas]: Not known for his mathematical prowess. Considering his Three Musketeers is about four musketeers, I'm not sure he could count, unless you count Monte Cristo.

[^liouville]: These papers were published in 1846 after Liouville (yet another famous mathematician) read the papers in 1842 and recognized their importance. It's a bit unclear what prompted Liouville to read the papers or why he only did so 10 years after Galois' death.

[^translation]: Don't cry Alfred! I need all my courage to die at 20 years of age!
